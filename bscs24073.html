        A wise man once said : Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving.
        Life has no limitations, except the ones you make. It's your outlook on life that counts.If you want to lose 40 pounds, you order salad instead of fries. If you want to be a better friend, you take the phone call instead of screening it. If you want to write a novel, you sit down and write a single paragraph. It's scary to make major changes, but we usually have enough courage to take the next right step.
